Subject: **Trade-In Integration Setup - Real-Time Transaction Notifications**

---

Dear [Customer/Partner Name],

We're excited to inform you about our new **one-way API integration** that will streamline your trade-in operations and provide real-time transaction updates to your system.

## Integration Overview

Our integration provides **real-time notifications** whenever a trade-in transaction is completed at your location. This ensures your cashier and backend systems are immediately informed of all trade-in activities without any manual intervention.

## How It Works

### 1. Transaction Flow
- Customer completes trade-in evaluation using our device
- Trade-in offer is accepted and voucher is generated
- **Immediately upon completion**, our system sends transaction details to your specified API endpoint
- Your cashier receives notification through your existing system
- No interruption to customer flow - they proceed with their voucher as normal

### 2. Data We Send
When a transaction completes, we automatically send the following information to your API:

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "ABC123",
  "amount": 675.00
}
```

**That's it!** We keep the integration minimal and focused - only the essential voucher transaction ID and amount are transmitted for maximum simplicity and security.

### 3. Technical Requirements

**From Your Side:**
- Provide us with your API endpoint URL
- (Optional) Provide API authentication key if required
- Ensure your endpoint can accept POST requests with JSON payload
- Return HTTP 200 status for successful processing

**From Our Side:**
- We'll configure your endpoint in our system
- We'll provide test transactions for verification
- We handle all retry logic and error handling
- Integration is fail-safe - if your endpoint is unavailable, our trade-in process continues uninterrupted

## Benefits for Your Operations

✅ **Seamless Integration**: No changes to your existing POS or customer flow
